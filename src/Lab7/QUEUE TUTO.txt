1. Name four everyday examples of a queue other than those discussed during lecture.
- supermarket checkout line
- ticket counter at movie theater
- airport security checkpoint
- drive-thru at fast food restaurant

2. What is the difference between a queue and stack?
- stack uses last in first out (LIFO) principle
- queue uses first in first out (FIFO) principle

3. Use the following code segment to answer parts (a) through (c):
Queue<Integer> q = new Queue<Integer>();
Scanner keyIn = new Scanner(System.in);
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
    if (keyIn.nextBoolean())
    System.out.print(i + " ");
else
    q.enqueue(i);
}
while (!q.isEmpty())
System.out.print(q.dequeue() + " ");
System.out.println();

(a) What is the output for the following input sequence?
true false false true true
1 4 5 2 3

(b) Is it possible to have output: 1 3 5 4 2? If yes, give an input sequence that produces the
output; or else, provide justification to your answer.
No , because 4 and 2 are in reverse order

(c) Give at least three input sequences that produce the output: 1 2 3 4 5
true,true,true,false,false
true,true,true,true,true
true,true,true,true,false

4. Hand trace a queue X through the following operations:
 X.enqueue(new Integer(14));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(3));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(5));

 Object Y = X.dequeue();
 X.enqueue(new Integer(7));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(9));

 Y = X.dequeue();
 X.enqueue(new Integer(2));
 X.enqueue(new Integer(4));

Given the resulting queue X above, what would be the result of each of the following?
a) X.front();
5

b) Y = X.dequeue();
X.enqueue(new Integer(10));
X.front();
7

c) Y = X.dequeue();
7

d) X.front();
9

5. Provide and explain three operations / functions of Linked List based Queue that you can add
to the GenericQueue class, other than those discussed in the lecture (i.e., enqueue, dequeue
and getSize â€“ from Slide 10 in the lecture slide).
